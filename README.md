# First-Come-First-Serve-Scheduling
Operating System 
# Introduction
In this lab we are going to implement the FCFS Sheduling method using python and calculate the Waiting Time and Turn Around Time of each process.                  
We are also going to find the average Waiting and Turn Arounf Time.
# Working 
The program first take how many process are their in the queen, afterward take process id and brust time and then exute the process arounding to FCFS algorithum and give us the waiting and turn around time of each process
# Output
